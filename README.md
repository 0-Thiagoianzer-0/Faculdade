<h3>- This repository contains the projects of all semesters carried out at my university (IDEAU)</h3>

I carried out practical projects covering the contents of each semester, each project contains details in a scientific paper requested by the university.

<h4>All projects are divided in files by semester(year/semester):</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>First(2018/2):</h4>
    <p>Project of analysis and specification of necessary requirements for software destined to the livestock area, especially for the handling of the herds, to assist farmers, assisting them in the decision-making process and also effectively recording the workload in livestock management.</p>
    <p>A requirements document extracted through software engineering techniques was prepared in order to meet the requirements of the proposed software.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li
      ><h4>Second(2019/1):</h4>
    <p>Design and modeling of a system for herd management, based on a previously prepared requirements document. The software diagrams were made using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and appropriate software. A simple, intuitive and interactive user interface model was also developed to illustrate the structure and operation of the interface to its users, whose evaluations allowed developers to make the necessary adjustments before its implementation.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>Third(2019/2):</h4>
    <p>Design, modeling and implementation of a web system for a small glass store in Bagé-RS, aiming to improve the performance of its daily activities, providing organization and control of its stock of materials, as well as keeping up to date its customer base and the history of services provided to each
client.</p>
    <p>The software was implemented using the paradigm of structured programming, using PHP, together with the PostgreSQL database, developed from an ER diagram, and the server chosen to host the system was Apache.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>Fourth(2020/1):</4>
    <p>This project addresses the process of developing a mobile application for android devices that will work integrated with a web system developed in a previous work, in order to facilitate the management and development of a company's activities, enabling access to information at any time and place, as well as making it possible for new information is entered in real time, requiring internet access.</p>
    <p>The application was being developed following the object-oriented paradigm in the Java language, using the Android Studio IDE for the development and testing of the application. The database to be integrated, made in PostgreSQL.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>Fifth(2020/2):</4>
    <p>Project to develop a web system to help companies adapt to the new Brazilian law, the General Data Protection Law (LGPD). The system provides a questionnaire with the main aspects of the LGPD in which it is necessary to fit, after answering these questions, the system generates a report based on the responses of the users and classifies their companies in three levels: low, medium and high.</p>
    <p>The system can be accessed from any device that has a web browser and Internet access. An ER diagram was created to support the development and maintenance of the database, and for the implementation of the system, PHP was used together with the database developed in PostgreSQL, hosted on an Apache server.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>Sixth(2021/1):</h4>
    <p>Development of an appointment scheduling system for the Psychology Clinic, which will assist in the practice of the Psychology Course classes at the IDEAU University Center in Bagé.</p>
    <p>An ER diagram was developed that served as the basis for the development of the database, using MySQL. The programming language used to implement the system was C, the graphical interface was developed using the Glade tool and the elements of the graphical interface were manipulated through the GTK+ 3 library.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>Seventh(2021/2):</h4>
    <p>Development of an information system for monitoring the body weight of a group of participants in a questionnaire applied during ten weeks, with the objective of collecting a series of specific data for a study involving their general habits. and its influence on your body weight.</p>
    <p>Graphic models were built in UML language, which served as a basis for the implementation of the system, for its implementation the IDE NetBeans, Java and Mysql were used.</p>
    <p>The system has a simple operation and allows the user to store and consult people's data, with options for its management, as well as generating reports that provide data related to people's habits, informing all the weighing data and carrying out their treatment. under arithmetic operations that inform the user about the situation.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h4>Eighth semester(2022/1):</h4>
    <p>Repository TCC, is a project maded in QT Creator and C++</p>
  </li>
</ul>
